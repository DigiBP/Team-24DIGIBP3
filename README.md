## Introduction
Mondetto is a swiss muscian and producer. He is an entrepreneur and works on different projects simultaneously. One service he offers is the finalizing (mixing and mastering) of songs. Recorded audio tracks are mixed together and various processes such as equalization (EQ), compression and reverb effects are used. At the moment, the whole process of creating an order for him is manual.

He receives requests via various channels (WhatsApp, Instagram, SMS, email and so on). Customers contact him there and make an appointment with him. Customers also send him the necessary song files, with the audio tracks already recorded, via various channels. This is very time-consuming for him and also very confusing. In addition, he doesn't have a professional database of his customers and he also creates his invoices individually. He does this with the help of accounting software (Bexio), but this process is not automated either and has to be triggered and created manually. Last but not least, the delivery of his finalized songs is not automated and he has to send them back to the customer manually via the channel through which he received the song file at the time.


### As-Is Process
In this chapter we briefly explain the as-is process. We have documented it in a BPMN as well, which is added below. Until now, the process is fully manual and nothing is automated.
Mondetto currently receives orders via various channels. This can be via WhatsApp, Instagram, email, etc. In these messages, customers also send him their song files, which they would like to have edited and mixed. When he accepts an order, he saves these files on a local drive. He then has to manually check whether the file is in the correct format and whether he can use it. Once this is done, he discusses the schedule for creating the mix with the customer. Again, this is done manually via a communication platform. Once he has all the necessary information, he can then begin his work. Until then, he loses valuable time during which he could already be mixing songs.

Now he can start with his actual work, the mixing. As soon as he has finished, he uploads the finished song file for the customer. He usually does this manually via Dropbox Premium. Sometimes, however, this is also done via WhatsApp, Instagram or a similar platform. He also informs the customer that their song file has been completed.
The customer can now check whether they are happy with it or whether they would like any further adjustments. He informs Mondetto of this via one of the aforementioned communication platforms. If the customer is not yet satisfied, Mondetto edits the song file again and the upload process including customer information is repeated. 

When the customer is satisfied with the song file, the invoice for the service is issued. He creates the invoice manually and then sends it to the customer by e-mail. He then has to enter the invoice in his Bexio accounting software. He also manages it there and can use it to record payments. This is important for his dunning process and for keeping proper accounts. But he still has to do this manually. Finally, he closes the order for himself and it is then completed. 

![As-is Model](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-24DIGIBP3/blob/78ee0534811cd0ac4c58d37e8b95044916e23372/Pictures/As-is%20Mixing%20Order%20Management.png)


### Project Goals
The goal of the project is to digitalize the order management process of mondetto's mixing offering. Right now he is not working automated nor fully digital.
To change this he needs an automated process, where his customers can fulfill an order. In this process they should be able the send their data, make a choice for the service they want and also be able to upload their songs, which they want to have mixed by mondetto. Afterwards it should be automated how the customer gets a notifaction and how mondetto can view the uploaded mixing request.
Another pain point from the current process is, that Mondetto does not have an overview about his ongoing projects. This became a problem laltely, since his business has grown rapidly and he now also hires freelancers, who he can forward some tasks or projects to. This needs to be involved in the new process as well. He should be able to assign a song to one of the freelancers. Afterwards they can decide, if they want to accept the order or just ignore it. If they accept the job, they need to be able to send it back to Mondetto. Because he needs to verify every mixed song and check whether it meets its requirements. He may needs to adjust something before he sends it back to the customer.



## To-Be Process
To reach our project goals, the team had to create a completely new process and BPMN from the scratch. The full process is ad the end of this chapter.
First of all we had to discuss together with Mondetto, how he would like to have his future process and what is particularly important to him. 

### Receipt of the order
The first part of our process is the receipt of the order. We changed this completly. The process starts with the order request. This is triggered by a microsoft fomrs which the customer has to fill out. You can find the form in the [folder](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-24DIGIBP3/blob/main/Microsoft%20Forms/Customer%20form%20for%20the%20mixing%20order%20request.pdf) or it is also directly available under the [link to forms](https://forms.office.com/e/q00ES47EVk).

## Implementation
To implement the to-be process model and therefore to fulfill project goals we decided to rely on following architectural implementation.

### Architecture
![Architecture Overview](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-24DIGIBP3/blob/78ee0534811cd0ac4c58d37e8b95044916e23372/Pictures/Architecture.png)

**Camunda:** With Camunda we steer the whole process token flow. A BPMN & DMN Model was deployed to the server. Mostly Camunda is using Service Tasks, which are calling via REST http  a Workflow deployed in Power Automate. If asynchronous answers are needed back, mainly messages were used that will be send by Power Automate or Buttons that are being clicked from Customer directly both via Camunda REST API. Mondetto will use Camunda to handle "Manual" User-Tasks. Freelancer or Clients will not have access to Camunda.
**Microsoft:** We decided to use the powerful capabilities of Microsoft for multiple purposes. For service integration we used Power Automate, for Email-correspondance Outlook, for Enter a new Mixing request MS Forms, for Data management of song files as well as a Voucher database we relied on SharePoint. 

**Bexio:** is a accounting tool and Mondetto is currently using it to manually enter invoices and managing customers. We used the bexio API https://docs.bexio.com/ to interact with customer database and handling invoices.
