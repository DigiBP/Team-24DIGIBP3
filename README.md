## Introduction
Mondetto is a swiss muscian and producer. He is an entrepreneur and works on different projects simultaneously. One service he offers is the finalizing (mixing and mastering) of songs. Recorded audio tracks are mixed together and various processes such as equalization (EQ), compression and reverb effects are used. At the moment, the whole process of creating an order for him is manual.

He receives requests via various channels (WhatsApp, Instagram, SMS, email and so on). Customers contact him there and make an appointment with him. Customers also send him the necessary song files, with the audio tracks already recorded, via various channels. This is very time-consuming for him and also very confusing. In addition, he doesn't have a professional database of his customers and he also creates his invoices individually. He does this with the help of accounting software (Bexio), but this process is not automated either and has to be triggered and created manually.

Last but not least, the delivery of his finalized songs is not automated and he has to send them back to the customer manually via the channel through which he received the song file at the time.


### Project Goals
The goal of the project is to digitalize the order management process of mondetto's mixing offering. Right now he is not working automated nor fully digital.
To change this he needs an automated process, where his customers can fulfill an order. In this process they should be able the send their data, make a choice for the service they want and also be able to upload their songs, which they want to have mixed by mondetto. Afterwards it should be automated how the customer gets a notifaction and how mondetto can view the uploaded mixing request.
