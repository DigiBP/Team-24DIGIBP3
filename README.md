## Introduction üé¨ü§ù
Mondetto is a swiss muscian and producer. He is an entrepreneur and works on different projects simultaneously. One service he offers is the finalizing (mixing and mastering) of songs. This is where recorded audio tracks are mixed together and various processes such as equalization (EQ), compression and reverb effects are deployed. At the moment, the whole process of creating an order is manual. Neither he nor his customers can benefit from simple and automated mixing order management.

He receives requests via various communication channels and social media. Customers contact him there and make an appointment with him. Customers also send him there the necessary song files with their recorded audio tracks. This is very time-consuming for him and also very confusing. In addition, he doesn't have a professional database of his customers and he also creates his invoices individually. He does this with the help of the accounting software Bexio, but this process is not automated either and has to be triggered and created manually. Last but not least, the delivery of his finalized songs is not automated and he has to send them back to the customer manually via the channel through which he received the song file before.

Another pain point for him at the moment is that he can only forward his song files to partners in a very complicated way, if at all. Due to the growth of his business and the increasing demand for his services, he would like to regularly hire freelancers in the future who can do the work for him and also create mixings. They would be paid a flat rate and the mixings would always be checked and finalized by Mondetto at the end, so that the customer still has the ‚ÄúMondetto label‚Äù.


### As-Is Process 
In this chapter we briefly explain the as-is process. We have documented it in a BPMN as well, which is added below. Until now, the process is fully manual and nothing is automated.
Mondetto currently receives orders via various channels. This can be via WhatsApp, Instagram, email, etc. In these messages, customers also send him their song files, which they would like to have edited and mixed. When he accepts an order, he saves these files on a local drive. He then has to manually check whether the file is in the correct format and whether he can use it. Once this is done, he discusses the schedule for creating the mix with the customer. Again, this is done manually via a communication platform. Once he has all the necessary information, he can then begin his work. Until then, he loses valuable time during which he could already be mixing songs.

Now he can start with his actual work, the mixing. As soon as he has finished, he uploads the finished song file for the customer. He usually does this manually via Dropbox Premium. Sometimes, however, this is also done via WhatsApp, Instagram or a similar platform. He also informs the customer that their song file has been completed.
The customer can now check whether they are happy with it or whether they would like any further adjustments. He informs Mondetto of this via one of the aforementioned communication platforms. If the customer is not yet satisfied, Mondetto edits the song file again and the upload process including customer information is repeated. 

When the customer is satisfied with the song file, the invoice for the service is issued. He creates the invoice manually and then sends it to the customer by e-mail. He then has to enter the invoice in his Bexio accounting software. He also manages it there and can use it to record payments. This is important for his dunning process and for keeping proper accounts. But he still has to do this manually. Finally, he closes the order for himself and it is then completed.

### Project Goals 
The goal of the project is to digitalize the order management process of mondetto's mixing offering. Right now he is not working automated nor fully digital.
To change this he needs an automated process, where his customers can fulfill an order. In this process they should be able the send their data, make a choice for the service they want and also be able to upload their songs, which they want to have mixed by mondetto. Afterwards it should be automated how the customer gets a notifaction and how mondetto can view the uploaded mixing request.
Another pain point from the current process is, that Mondetto does not have an overview about his ongoing projects. This became a problem laltely, since his business has grown rapidly and he now also hires freelancers, who he can forward some tasks or projects to. This needs to be involved in the new process as well. He should be able to assign a song to one of the freelancers. Afterwards they can decide, if they want to accept the order or just ignore it. If they accept the job, they need to be able to send it back to Mondetto. Because he needs to verify every mixed song and check whether it meets its requirements. He may needs to adjust something before he sends it back to the customer.



## To-Be Process ‚öôÔ∏è‚úÖ
To reach our project goals, the team had to create a completely new process and BPMN from the scratch. The full process is ad the end of this chapter.
First of all we had to discuss together with Mondetto, how he would like to have his future process and what is particularly important to him. 

### Business perspective
We would like to give you first, a comprehensive textual outline of the to-be process from a more business perspective. 

**Order request, payment and order confirmation** 

The first part of our process is the receipt of the order. We changed this completly. The process starts with the order request. This is triggered by a microsoft forms which the customer has to fill out.

Afterwards the data are forwarded to bexio and it checks, if there is already a customer with this e-mail address. If not, there is automatically a new customer created in bexio. The next step is a check, weather Mondetto has some capacity to fullfill the order. If not, the order will be cancelled and the the process ends there.

When there is some capacity, the next step is to calculate the price of the services. There it depends, which service type (express, advanced or basic) and which amount of songs (one to five) the customer has choosen in his order request in forms. In the price calculation is also the option of a voucher included (customers can get vouchers from Mondetto for example if he is delayed with his delivery). When the price is calculated, the system sends an offer via e-mail to the customer. He has 12 hours to accept it via a link. If he does not do so within this time, the order is canceled and the process ends. If he confirms via the link within this time, a payment request is automatically triggered and the customer receives another e-mail with payment link. The services are always paid in advance. After the payment has been validated, an invoice is generated in Bexio and an order confirmation with the invoice/payment confirmation is sent to the customer by e-mail.

**Mixing task**

Only now Mondetto's task begins. He checks the order and decides whether to carry out the job himself or assign it to one of his freelancers. If he takes it on himself, he starts mixing and as soon as he has finished, his task is complete. If he forwards the order to a freelancer, the freelancer receives the order by e-mail. The freelancer in turn has 12 hours to accept the job. If this does not happen, Mondetto mixes the song himself. Otherwise, the process waits until the freelancer has finished the job and then passes the song on to Mondetto for a quality check. If, in his opinion, adjustments are necessary, he makes them immediately. The task is then completed. If the delivery time for the whole order is exceeded (delivery date is over), a voucher is automatically created for the customer and sent directly to them by e-mail.

**Adjustments** 

After the mixing task has been completed, the songs are delivered to the customer. They can download and check the songs using the provided SharePoint link. If the customer is satisfied with the song, he does not have to do anything else and the process is automatically be completed after 3 days and the order is thus fulfilled. However, if the customer wants to make adjustments to the song, he must report this within 3 days. In this case, Mondetto adjusts the song respective the comment from the customer and uploads the new file to Sharepoint again for the customer. The customer can request an adjustment 3 times. After the 3rd time, the order is directly fullfilled and the process is completed.

## Implementation üì°üß©
To implement the to-be process model and therefore to fulfill project goals we decided to rely on following architectural implementation.

### Architecture Overview
**Camunda:** With Camunda we steer the whole process token flow. A BPMN & DMN Model was deployed to the [server](https://digibp.herokuapp.com/engine-rest). Mostly Camunda is using Service Tasks, which are calling via a HTTP call a Workflow deployed in Power Automate. If asynchronous answers are needed back, mainly messages were used that will be sent by Power Automate or Buttons that are being clicked from Customer directly both via Camunda REST API Message calls. Mondetto will use Camunda to handle "Manual" User-Tasks. Freelancer or Clients will not have access to Camunda.

**Microsoft:** We decided to use the powerful capabilities of Microsoft for multiple purposes. We created a completely new Microsoft tenant (mondetto.onmicrosoft.com) so we could steer all Admin settings without interfearing the current set-up from Mondetto. We created 5 Users that all have a Power Plattform Premium and a Microsoft E3 License. We used following components of Microsoft:

>**PowerAutomate** For service integration we used Power Automate.

>**Forms** for entering a new Mixing request Form by a customer. You can find the form in the [folder](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-24DIGIBP3/blob/main/Microsoft%20Forms/Customer%20form%20for%20the%20mixing%20order%20request.pdf) or it is also directly available under the [link to forms](https://forms.office.com/e/q00ES47EVk). The Form is currently only accesible for mondetto.onmicrosoft.com internal users and will be made public later in go-live of solution. 

>**SharePoint** We created the SharePoint site: https://mondetto.sharepoint.com/sites/DigiBP/ for multiple purposes. We used [document library](https://mondetto.sharepoint.com/sites/DigiBP/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx) for the management of the song & invoice files. Furthemore we used a SP-List as our [Voucher database](https://mondetto.sharepoint.com/sites/DigiBP/Lists/VoucherList/AllItems.aspx).

>**Outlook** for Email-correspondance.

**Bexio:** is a accounting tool and Mondetto is currently using it to manually enter invoices and managing customers. We used the bexio API https://docs.bexio.com/ to interact with customer database and handling invoices.

![Architecture Overview](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-24DIGIBP3/blob/78ee0534811cd0ac4c58d37e8b95044916e23372/Pictures/Architecture.png)




### Process Variables üî°‚öôÔ∏è
The following process variables were being used in Camunda. The variables can have different initialization sources: 1. In Camunda directly by (manual user) input, calculation (DMN) or script tasks. 2. By HTTP responses from a Service Task (Power Automate). By receiving a variable loaded message sent to the process instance.

## Outlook üî≠üîÆ
The fact that we worked very closely with Mondetto throughout the project means that our solution is practically tailor-made for him. He was able to bring in all his needs and we created the process individually according to his wishes. We also made sure that it was feasible for him. 
We have already presented the project to Mondetto and he is delighted. He wants to implement the new version of his mixing order management process as soon as possible. To do this, he first needs to purchase a Microsoft 365 business premium license. This gives him access to all the tools he needs, such as PowerAutomate, Microsoft Forms, Sharepoint, etc. In addition, he must have access to Camunda. Our team will then implement the process so that Mondetto will soon be able to use the automated mixing order management process. We have also calculated the monthly costs for him, if he wants to implement our project. There will be estimated costs of about CHF 35.- per month and he is sure that this is definitely worth it.
